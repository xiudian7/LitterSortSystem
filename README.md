# LitterSortSystem

Since the implementation of waste sorting policies in 2019, starting from the 46 pilot cities, waste sorting has become an important requirement in urban life. Waste sorting contributes to the cleanliness and convenience of our daily lives, as well as the efficient utilization of recycled materials. However, for many people, identifying and correctly disposing of different types of waste can be challenging. People living in large cities often have their time and energy squeezed by daily life, leaving them with little time or inclination to systematically learn the specialized knowledge of waste sorting.

Traditional manual waste sorting techniques suffer from low efficiency, long processing times, heavy reliance on manpower, and poor working conditions. Therefore, finding effective ways to automate waste sorting has become an urgent issue.
